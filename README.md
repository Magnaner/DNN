## Welcome to My GitHub Pages

Hello world! I'm here!

I leverage past AI experience to learn new data science techniques, advanced algorithms, machine learning, deep learning and "bots" for fun. Still passionate after over 20 years!

This repo contains code inspired from my first 3 Coursera online courses with **Deeplearning.ai from Andrew Ng**, professor at Sanford University. It provides all the basic ingredients of a fully connected Deep Neural Network **(DNN)** built _**from scratch**_. 

The main code can be run from the _Run_My_DNN.py_ file. It is set-up by default for a binary classification neural net (yes/no, red/blue, 1/0) using a sigmoid activation at the last (output) layer. Softmax can be used instead, but I have not yet made it so you can specify the output layer for "n" classes (one-hot vectors).

I h some might find this code usefull, somehow.

Good reading!
EM.
